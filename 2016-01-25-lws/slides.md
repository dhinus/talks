# Get your own mini-Heroku with Dokku
In five minutes (fingers crossed)

# What is Dokku?

The smallest PaaS implementation you've ever seen

Seriously: a set of bash scripts

You can trigger with<br>`git push`

Building your app in a Docker container

Using the official Heroku buildpacks

And configuring an nginx virtualhost


# Pros

Supports Procfiles and Dockerfiles

Easy to add DBs (with official plugins)

Maintained, documented and tested

Unlike you hacky deploy scripts

(or mine)


# Cons

Does not scale OMGZ!!1!11

Only one host

No user management

No web interface

No docker-compose (limited support coming soon)


# Why you should use it

Coolness: Docker in production(ish)

Less is more

Maybe you don't really need Kubernetes


# DEMO


# Thanks
